                    <h1>Ben Choy</h1>
                    <p>Iâ€™m Ben, a musician based in south Derbyshire (UK Midlands).
                    Music began for me when I was 4 years old. I count myself lucky and so grateful to my parents who encouraged me to learn
                    the piano at that age as it has become a passion I couldnâ€™t imagine life without.
                    My education and technical training as a Classical musician with the ABRSM (Associated Board of the Royal Schools of
                    Music) led me to achieve Grade 8 piano Distinction, a Diploma in Piano Music Performance and a Bachelor of Arts Degree
                    in Music & Management Sciences at the University of Southampton. My interest in Jazz & Contemporary music led me to
                    expand my repertoire and extend my performances of these musical genres at Weddings and other special social & corporate
                    events. As violinist also, my experience performing with orchestras in Milton Keynes and Derbyshire led my background
                    interest in orchestral works and compositions.
                    Since 2001, as a musician I have been performing to audiences in town halls, theatres and concert halls across the UK
                    including the Royal Albert Hall & Royal Festival Hall in London, Birmingham Symphony Hall, along with other venues
                    Buckinghamshire, Cambridgeshire, Derbyshire, Greater Manchester, Hampshire, Leicestershire, Northamptonshire and
                    Somerset. I have performing overseas too in Austria (Salzburg), Italy (northern region of Val Dâ€™Aosta, and southern
                    region of Puglia) and Malaysia (Kuala Lumpur). In 2004, a personal highlight was performing Edvard Griegâ€™s piano
                    concerto in A minor with full backing of an Orchestra of 40 musicians.

                            Listed here is an example selection of music that Ben can be perform as a combination of original and musically adapted
                            versions. These are provided to give you an indication of the range of music that can be performed, however if there are
                            other musical styles at home (posted on my YouTube channel or Instagram) to give you an idea of the beautiful sounds
                            created ðŸ™‚ So if your venue does not already have a piano, I will bring my stage piano which can be set up at any
                            location of your choosing!<br>
                            I have also been active helping volunteering as a musical contributor to local organisations. Before moving up to
                            Derbyshire, over the space of 7 years I composed & wrote musical arrangements to Western & Eastern oriental music, which
                            I then used to lead rehearsals every Sunday with students between ages 7-16 at the Milton Keynes Community Chinese
                            School. As a music writer and conductor, i rehearsed with the pupils to give them an opportunity to perform in front of
                            their family and friends every year during our local town Chinese New Year celebrations, as well as nationally organised
                            events run by the UK Federation of Chinese Schools held in locations including London and Manchester.
