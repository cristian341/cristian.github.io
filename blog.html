                        <h1>Rebecca Harris-Duggan & Christopher Duggan</h1>
                        <p>We’d highly recommend Ben as a wedding pianist to anyone! He was a pleasure to deal with throughout the process and his piano playing on the day was just perfect.

                            Ben was always easy to get hold of by email, text or phone; his communication was excellent.  He worked with us in the weeks running up to the wedding to develop a ‘playlist’ of music for different parts of the day and he wasn’t prescriptive about choosing from a list of music that he knows – he very much let us guide the process and gave us the comfort he would be able to learn any songs we wanted to hear on the day. He then complimented our choices with suggestions from his own (extensive!) repertoire.
                            
                            On the day he arrived comfortably in time to start playing as our guests were arriving and enjoying a drinks reception prior to the ceremony – he played a mix ranging from Classical (Debussy, Mozart etc.) to interpretations of modern popular music, including some songs we’d chosen and various others of his choosing that were well judged for the occasion and audience.
                            
                            Ben played again during our cake cutting where we’d agreed a more prescriptive list of songs in a specific order, at specific times. He performed these beautifully and even stayed to play a song close to our heart as a private ‘first dance’ prior to us joining our guests for our wedding breakfast –  this was a really special moment and hadn’t been agreed with him in advance, he offered this to us in the moment of his own volition.
                            
                            Ben engages in a professional and friendly manner with wedding guests and in our case he was happy to take requests and improvise around certain songs – he clearly enjoys his work and it never felt to us that this was ‘just another wedding’ to him.</p>

                        <h1>Amelia Mistry & Atul Mistry</h1>
                        <p>When planning our wedding day, we were lucky enough to be put in touch with Ben. It was unequivocally clear when we met him how talented and passionate Ben is for playing the piano; he loved our ideas as much as we did and nothing was too much trouble. We had songs ranging from 90s pop, modern classic and classical music. 

                            Ben was a consummate professional and we were able to worry about one less thing during the whole planning stage, confident in the knowledge that Ben would be both reliable yet spectacular on the day. We were right to have our faith in him!  
                            
                            On the day, we asked Ben to play piano as guests arrived and during the ceremony, from the entrance of the bride walking down the aisle, to signing of the register and exiting the ceremony. He even led our “hymn” in the service which was a song by Gabrielle ‘Dreams’ whilst everyone sang along!  During our marriage ceremony it was so special to hear him play during the tears and the laughter. He helped make the atmosphere nothing short of magical on the day. It really was, so special. 
                            
                            Everyone commented on how beautiful it was to have a live pianist throughout, and were beyond complimentary of not only Ben’s musical talent but also, his calm, smiley and joyful demeanour. I wish I had filmed the ceremony so I could listen to him over and over again! 
                            
                            Thank you Ben!</p>
