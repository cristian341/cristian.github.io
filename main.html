                <p>Ranking amongst the UK’s most-booked pianists, Michael Raggatt is in demand across world-renowned venues in his home city of London, as well as travelling nationally and internationally to perform. He has brought his touch of unique and refined elegance to events at Savoy Hotel, the FA Cup Final, Dubai's famous 'Palm Island’ and more, as well as drawing on many years of experience to create exceptional tailored wedding programmes. 

    

                    Michael is highly accomplished in styles ranging from light classical music, such as Debussy and Chopin, to well-loved jazz standards and modern chart hits, and can accommodate requests in almost any genre. His care and attention to detail at each event has earned him five stars in 100% of his reviews.
